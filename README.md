# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_POPULAR_MOVIES_DATA

Over the course of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze popular movies using a comprehensive dataset. The dashboard provides in-depth insights through key performance indicators (KPIs), including average ratings, relevance scores, and counts of total movies, unique users, ratings, tags, genres, and genome tags. These KPIs offer valuable insights into movie trends and user engagement. This project strengthened my expertise in data visualization and trend analysis using Power BI. By interpreting user preferences and movie data effectively, I was able to create a dynamic dashboard that presents clear and actionable insights. The project files are available on GitHub for further reference and development, providing an opportunity to build upon and extend the analysis.
